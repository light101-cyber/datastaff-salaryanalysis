**Introduction**

In today's data-driven landscape, understanding compensation patterns and trends is paramount to attracting and retaining top talent. The "Data Staff Salary Analysis" project delves into the intricate world of salaries within the data space. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on key aspects of compensation, from descriptive statistics and job roles to experience-based comparisons and regional influences.

To embark on this data-driven journey, we will begin by importing essential Python libraries that will serve as the foundation for our analysis. We will then dive into the world of descriptive statistics, examining the salary parameter to gain valuable insights.

Our exploration continues with the creation of a frequency table to visualize the distribution of salaries, followed by the construction of histograms for a clearer understanding of this distribution.

The heart of our analysis lies in deciphering the variety of jobs within the data space and identifying predominant job roles. We will provide both detailed insights and concise summaries to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data job landscape.

Furthermore, we will conduct in-depth comparisons, juxtaposing roles with experience levels and extracting meaningful insights. Salary comparisons based on job titles will offer a unique perspective on compensation within the data industry.

The project is one that is fairly simple, but had a major real-life use case for me. At the time of creating this, I was a freelance Data Analyst who wasn't fully decided yet on the career I wanted for myself within the data sector, what role I would like to work, how I would like to work, what country I would like to settle, amongst other things. I embarked on this project to try and answer the many questions I had regarding my work and my future, and hopefully you enjoy my presentation.
