The \"Data Staff Salary Analysis\" project delves into the intricate world of salaries within the data space. This comprehensive analysis aims to shed light on key aspects of compensation, from descriptive statistics and job roles to experience-based comparisons and regional influences.\n\nTo embark on this data-driven journey, we will begin by importing essential Python libraries that will serve as the foundation for our analysis. We will then dive into the world of descriptive statistics, examining the salary parameter to gain valuable insights.\n\nOur exploration continues with the creation of a frequency table to visualize the distribution of salaries, followed by the construction of histograms for a clearer understanding of this distribution.\n\nThe heart of our analysis lies in deciphering the variety of jobs within the data space and identifying predominant job roles. We will provide both detailed insights and concise summaries to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the data job landscape.\n\nFurthermore, we will conduct in-depth comparisons, juxtaposing roles with experience levels and extracting meaningful insights. Salary comparisons based on job titles will offer a unique perspective on compensation within the data industry.\n\nThis is my first real Data Analysis project. it's a project I started out of curiousity, being an aspiring data personnel with decent enough skills at Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and SQL(at the time, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be an ML engineer, data scientist or data analyst), I decided to carry out this analysis to help me reach some form of understanding of certain things which you would find out as you read through the analysis.","metadata":{"id":"t6iHgQG7fwwF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Importing all python libraries that would be needed all through the analysis**","metadata":{"id":"1gacXHOllvi8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing all libraries that would be used in the analaysis\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.interpolate import make_interp_spline","metadata":{"id":"Mlvw7RPnm_dg","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T14:20:10.798112Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T14:20:10.798519Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T14:20:10.803701Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T14:20:10.798479Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T14:20:10.802559Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/employee-salaries-for-different-job-roles/ds_salaries.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{"id":"VFDrWBZXnTqJ","outputId":"23dd1aed-74ad-4fb9-ae94-35745088c360","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.441831Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.442238Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.470020Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.442207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.468699Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Descriptive Statistics for the Salary Parameter**\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"OxppxNTtldGz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##Creating a frequency table for the distribution\nFor the frequency distribution table, I chose to use 25k intervals for the salary range.\n","metadata":{"id":"EH2Liy8ZAE8Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Creating a frequency table for the distribution\nsalary_intervals = range(1, 600002, 25000) #Creates 25k intervals for salaries between 0 and 625k(all values)\nlabels = [f\"${i}-{i+25000-1}\" for i in salary_intervals[:-1]]\n\n# Categorize salaries into intervals and calculate frequencies\ndf['salary_intervals'] = pd.cut(df['salary_in_usd'], bins=salary_intervals, labels=labels, right=False)\nfrequency_df = df['salary_intervals'].value_counts().reset_index()\nfrequency_df.columns = ['Salary Range', 'Frequency']\nfrequency_df = frequency_df.sort_values(by='Salary Range')\nfrequency_df = frequency_df.reset_index()\nprint(frequency_df)\n","metadata":{"id":"KTCZjAGTuV_I","outputId":"e984725d-3dfb-4c15-bea9-d4e457048f6b","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.472120Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.472498Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.503093Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.472452Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.501767Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Plotting a histogram to visualize the frequency distribution\n","metadata":{"id":"k2uL-ZuvAeww"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Extract lower and upper salary limits for plotting\nfrequency_df['Lower Salary'] = frequency_df['Salary Range'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[0][1:]))\nfrequency_df['Upper Salary'] = frequency_df['Salary Range'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[1][1:]))\n\n# Create a histogram using Matplotlib\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(frequency_df['Salary Range'], frequency_df['Frequency'], color='blue')\nplt.title('Salary Distribution')\nplt.xlabel('Salary Range')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","metadata":{"id":"eRn6olHBAmXf","outputId":"52f906d8-b001-45a6-8653-a7cbb808bdde","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.504395Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.504735Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.019605Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:11.504705Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.018487Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##**Descriptive Statistics from frequency distribution**\n\nFrom the histogram plot, we can analyze the following attributes:\n\n1. Central Tendency: The modal salary range is 75001-100000, and the mean and median is somewhere between 75000-125000. We would examine the exact figures below.\n\n2. Skewness: The data exhibits a positive/right skew. This means the outliers are on the right side(majority of outliers are those earning way more than the common range of salaries)\n\n3. Spread, Variability, and Data Density: Though the data spread is very high(the histogram ranges from 1-600,000), there is high variability in the data. However, from the histogram, we can infer that the highest data density is in the 50000-150000 range.\n\n4. Outliers: Having already stated that the distribution has a right skew, majority of the outliers are on the right side of the distribution(between 400000-600000).\n\n5. Unimodal Distribution: The histogram has only one peak, the data exhibits one mode, suggesting that the data is unimodal (having a single mode).\n\n6. Symmetry: A symmetric histogram indicates that the data is evenly distributed around the mean, while an asymmetric histogram suggests an uneven distribution.\n\n7. Data Clusters and Patterns: By examining the shape of the histogram, you can identify data clusters or patterns that might provide insights into the underlying characteristics of the data.\n\n8. Range of Values: From the dataset, we see that the minimum salary value is 2809 and the maximum is 600000.\n\nIt is important to note that while histograms provide useful visual insights, they may not provide all the statistical details we might need. Further statistical analysis, such as measures of central tendency(mean, median and mode), dispersion(Standard deviation and variance), and other tests, are required to draw more concrete conclusions.\n\n\n","metadata":{"id":"XIjBMocnIAJg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"salary_stats = df['salary_in_usd'].describe()\nsalary_stats","metadata":{"id":"XMZShdGin903","outputId":"a82b796f-9d69-4322-fb51-085e15b8bcf6","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.023214Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.024028Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.038322Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.023979Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.037140Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From a quick look at the basic descriptive statistics drawn from the 'salary_in_usd' parameter, it is very easy to see that there is a very massive range between data scientist salaries across the globe.

This means the outliers are on the right side(majority of outliers are those earning way more than the common range of salaries)\n\nThe highest levels of variation however, are in the bottom-earning quarter(Q1 or 25th percentile) and top-earning quarter(Q4 ir 76th-99th percentile), with the 25th percentile having salaries ranging from 2,859 to 62,726 USD per annum (the top value of the percentile being nearly 22x the minimum), and the top 25% having salaries ranging from 150,000 to 600,000 USD annually (the top value of the percentile being 4x the minimum). The middle of the pack (25th-75th percentile) sits pretty ranging from ~63000 to 150,000 USD.\n\nKey takeaways from this include:\n- Having the mean and median salary values at over 2x the average personal income in the United States and 10x the global personal income, it is safe to say that data-related professions are very high-paying globally.\n\n- There is a very high salary variability between data professions earnings globally. This could be due to a number of factors like work experience level of the staff, employee residence, company location, company size, job title amongst others, which we would look into in more depth along the line.","metadata":{"id":"1nm1nHHhRJZD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Variety of Jobs in the Data Space & Predominant Job Roles Analysis**","metadata":{"id":"_wN8QQEAhF-F"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Identifying number of unique job titles in the dataset\njob_titles = df['job_title'].unique()\nlen(job_titles)","metadata":{"id":"SUJL2g57Yxf8","outputId":"f14e45aa-3447-4efa-cd9a-9e90b570f3ae","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.040156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.040535Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.051682Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.040505Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.050068Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":" #Creating a new dataframe containing each job role and number of times they appeared in the dataset\n\njob_title_counts = df['job_title'].value_counts()\njob_title_df = pd.DataFrame({'job_title': job_title_counts.index, 'count': job_title_counts.values})\njob_title_df.head()","metadata":{"id":"C6KFFb2Ka7TI","outputId":"8283a643-026b-4750-a14d-01654d527323","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.053854Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.054344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.072256Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.054300Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.070277Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Create a bar plot to visualize the data that had been sorted above\nplt.figure(figsize=(7,10))\nsns.barplot(x='count', y='job_title', data = job_title_df)\nplt.title('Job roles of employees')\nplt.ylabel('Job Title')\nplt.xlabel('Number of employees')\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"id":"C8oAIYqeeaPM","outputId":"4cda12c2-822a-4b89-c722-c62c9ed55d97","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.073798Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.074423Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-09-01T13:21:13.040637Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-09-01T13:21:12.074375Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-09-01T13:21:13.039421Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##**Variety of Jobs in the Data Space & Predominant Job Roles Summary**\n\nIt's worth noting that there are 50 different job titles recorded in a dataset with just 607 employees!

The \"Data Staff Salary Analysis\" project has embarked on an illuminating journey through the intricacies of compensation within the data space, unearthing valuable insights and trends that can shape the future of talent management and career decisions.\n\nThroughout our analysis, we have harnessed the power of descriptive statistics to comprehend the nuances of salary distributions. From frequency tables to histograms, we visualized these distributions, revealing the diversity in compensation ranges that exist within the data field.\n\nOur exploration of job roles provided a comprehensive view of the data job landscape. By identifying predominant roles and examining their compensation, we have not only broadened our understanding of job variety but also unveiled critical information that can inform career choices and talent acquisition strategies.\n\nDelving deeper, our experience-based salary comparisons have highlighted the intricate relationship between years of experience and compensation levels. These insights are invaluable for both individuals looking to negotiate their salaries and organizations aiming to benchmark their compensation packages.\n\nThe analysis of salaries based on job titles has brought forth a nuanced perspective on how different roles are rewarded within the data sector. This information can guide both job seekers and employers in making informed decisions.\n\nRegional influences on salaries have been thoroughly investigated, underlining the significance of geography in compensation. These findings have the potential to reshape hiring strategies and salary structures to reflect regional disparities.\n\nFinally, our examination of remote work trends has shown the increasing popularity of this mode of employment within the data industry. This trend not only offers opportunities for greater work-life balance but also presents fresh challenges and considerations in salary negotiation and management.\n\nIn essence, the \"Data Staff Salary Analysis\" project has offered a multifaceted view of compensation within the data field. It is our hope that the insights uncovered here will empower individuals to make informed career choices and organizations to optimize their talent strategies. By understanding the dynamics of salaries in this ever-evolving landscape, we pave the way for a more equitable, competitive, and prosperous future in the data industry.\n\nAs data continues to shape our world, let these findings be a guiding light for those navigating their path within this exciting and dynamic field.","metadata":{}}]}
